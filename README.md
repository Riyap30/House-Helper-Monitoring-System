# House-Helper-Monitoring-System

There is a need for a digital system to maintain a 
record of the comings and goings of maids from various 
establishments. Apart from this, it has to be ensured that the 
maids are in a good health condition to work in different 
households. In this pandemic, it is essential that the maids are 
safe and are not a threat to the members of societies they work 
in. A system that keeps a track of the entries of maids into 
societies along with some parameters (temperature and oxygen) 
that ensure the good health of the maid for the well-being of 
both the maids and the members of the society is needed in this 
current crisis, which is exactly what we have created.
